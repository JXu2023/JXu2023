### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
In the 2022 summer intership supervised by [Professor Jian Pei](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/jian-pei) at Duke University, I conducted a research project on finding multidimensional Simpson's paradox and obtained a series of interesting insights that have not been reported in literature.  Our findings are reported in the following article.

J. Xu, J. Pei, and Z. Cong: ["Finding Multidimensional Simpson's Paradox"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4231689).
