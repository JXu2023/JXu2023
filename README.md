### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jay Xu, a highschool senior at Burnaby Mountain with a voracious appetite for learning. When I completed the math and science curriculums at my highschool in grade 9, I studied concurrently at Stanford OHS and other local universities. I enjoy solving math problems and writing new programs. I'm looking for a university where I can further develop my passions.
