### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jay Xu, a highschool senior at Burnaby Mountain with a voracious appetite for learning. When I completed the math and science curriculums at my highschool in grade 9, I studied concurrently at Stanford OHS and other local universities. I enjoy solving math problems and writing new programs. I'm looking for a university where I can further develop my passions. 

In the 2022 summer intership supervised by [Professor Jian Pei](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/jian-pei) at Duke University, I conducted a fantastic research project on finding multidimensional Simpson's paradox and obtained a series of interesting insights that have not been reported in literature.  Our findings are reported in the following article.
